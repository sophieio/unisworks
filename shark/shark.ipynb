      "    \"Have you ever had a crazy adventure with an animal?  Or maybe just an adventure that no one, not even your parents will believe?  If you have then you're not the only one because this is all about my adventure with the sharks.\",\n",
      "    \"It all happened in the middle of spring break, in Miami Florida, on the beach when I was examining seashells and wondering what I was going to do the next day.  Just then, I saw something brown swimming around. I stared at it for a second or two and then decided that I just saw seaweed floating on the water.\",\n",
      "    \"I looked away and continued to examine the seashells.  Again, I saw something brown but this time it was much closer than the last time.  It was close enough so I can see the shape body.  It was then I realized I saw shark fins and that it was a shark!\",\n",
      "    \"I went closer not daring to breath.  But strangely, the shark just stared at me and didn't bite.  Suddenly the shark started swimming so fast out to the middle of the ocean.  I followed it but it was too fast.  \\\"Stop!\\\" I screamed.  The shark turned around, seemed to nod and slowed down.\",\n",
      "    \"I was so surprised; my heart was beating fast, and I was wondering if it was a dream or not.  I closed my eyes and opened them.  I should be in my soft bed but I found myself still, next to the shark. The shark seemed to stop in front of a shipwreck.  I realized that I had not taken a breath for a long time but I was too excited to worry about that!\",\n",
      "    \"I entered a creaky old door with the shark.  I was scared but by the look of the shark's face I can tell that he was really use to this place.  I guessed that it was his home.\",\n",
      "    \"I was surprised to see other sharks.  There were two baby sharks and one fully grown female shark.  I guessed that this was his family.  There seemed to be odd objects in the shipwreck.  The two baby sharks seemed to be using an old doorknob, a really big one as a ball.  I joined in to play. The games were really fun and the food was surprisingly good!\",\n",
      "    \"It was getting dark.  I wanted to go back home and sleep in my cozy bed.  I opened the door of the shipwreck and looked out.  There was a long path with a thin wall so the water could not get in.  I just remembered that I could breath even if I was under water!  The path was reason why I can still breathe!\",\n",
      "    \"I went back home and slept till the next day.  I woke up and played with the sharks all day.  I visited them every single day and they always seemed to remember and understand me.\",\n",
      "    \"One day, my family and I went shopping.  I thought there would be no shark food but I still crossed my fingers and wished there was.\",\n",
      "    \"I asked the grocery workers if they had any shark food but all they said was, \\\"Do you think there is any shark food in a grocery store?\\\" They all laughed and I turned around sadly.  But just then, somebody turned around and poked me.  I turned around to see an old man.\",\n",
      "    \"He whispered something in my ear but I couldn't quite catch it right.  It sounded like, \\\"There home bark nood.\\\"  But then he came closer and whispered again.  I heard it quite clearly this time.  He was saying, \\\"There is some shark food here.\\\"\",\n",
      "    \"It turns out that he was listening to the whole conversation.  He lead me through a pathway, where almost nobody was there.  We came to a shelf and the old man tapped the shelf two times on the right and two times on the left.  The shelf opened!  There was a path that no one knew about.  I realized it was a secret door!\",\n",
      "    \"Inside, there was animal foods in all kind.  When I got to the shark food I was so happy!  The shark food looked a bit strange though.  When I touched it, there was a weird tingling sensation in my body.  Before I knew it I was two feet in the air screaming!  When I reached the ground, I realized the shark tooth necklace my mom gave me was gone.\",\n",
      "    \"The next day, something about the sharks changed.  Instead of being excited to see me, they were really fierce and often trying to bite me.  I gave the shark food and they enjoyed it, but they still seemed suspicious of me.  From that day on, I visited them every day, but they never seemed to understand or remember me ever again.\"\n",
