# If I Were a Snowflake

If I were a snowflake, I would wonder if I had a choice to live on the beautiful land below and have same clothes, food, schools and houses.  

But I would have my own pattern on my body that nobody has ever had.  

That pattern will always change.  

Sometimes I would change my pattern into stars, circles, and so on.  


When I was still wondering, I hadn't noticed that I was once inch from the ground.  

I touched the ground and melted.  

It was true that my body melted but my heart and wonders stayed there on earth.  

Then suddenly, the gloomy city filled  with light and color.  

Something about the city changed.  

No one knew it was one little snowflake who changed the whole city, but all their heads were filled with wonder.  

One little boy in a lonely street was wondering about snowflakes.
